# Make-a-Bluetooth-Controlled-Robot-Car
In this session, we’ll show you to build from scratch an Arduino-powered robot car that can be controlled remotely from your phone via Bluetooth. We’ll incorporate features like obstacle avoidance using ultrasonics—our car will sense objects blocking its path and automatically course-correct.  

Hardware required: 
—Arduino UNO 
—Servo Motors, Ultrasonic sensors &amp; 
-Chassis —L298N Motor Driver Shield 
—ESP8266 Expansion Board  

Software required: 
—Download the Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)
